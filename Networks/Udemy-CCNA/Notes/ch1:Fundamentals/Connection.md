- Ethernet LAN: coaxial cable (no longer used), twisted copper pair
    cable, fiber cable or wireless.
- PC to switches: Copper UTP
- Switch to Router: Straight-through cables
- The receive and transmit wires in a UTP cable can be wired to the
    `RJ-45` connector as either straight-through or crossover.
- Modern switches support `Auto MDI-X` where the receive and transmit
    signals are reconfigured automatically to yield the expected
    result.
- Fiber optic cables can be used to support longer distances or higher
    bandwidth requirements.
