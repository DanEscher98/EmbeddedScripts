- **POTS**: Plain Old Telephone Service is a retronym for voice-grade telephone service employing analog signal transmission over copper loops. POTS is characterized by several aspects:
    * Bi-directional (full duplex) communications.
    * Using balanced signaling of voltage analogs of sound pressure waves on a two-wire copper loop
    * Restricted to a narrow frequency range of 300–3,300 Hz, called the voiceband, which is much less than the human hearing range of 20–20,000 Hz
    * Call-progress tones, such as dial tone and ringing tone
    * Pulse dialing and dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF)
    * BORSCHT functions: battery feed (B), over-voltage protection (O), ringing (R), signaling (S), coding (C), hybrid (H), and test (T)
    * Loop start, ground start and E&M signalling

- **NIC**: A Network Interface Controller, also known as a network interface card, LAN adapter or physical network interface, is a computer hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network.

- **MAC address**: A Media Access Control Address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment
