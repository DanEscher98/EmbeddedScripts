List of toki pona words assembled from pu.  Public domain.

I think because of restrictions on hunspell affixes, proper nouns/loanwords are all marked as misspelled.  Also not fully compatible with linja pona (http://musilili.net/linja-pona/) style because underscores confuse it it seems (though if you're using linja pona fonts you probably don't need a red squiggle to recognise errors).
