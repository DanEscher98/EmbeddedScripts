COMMENT OF THE EXTENSION OWNER

This extension will add spellchecking dictionaries and hyphenation for Croatian (locales: hr-HR).
The extension is build from other ressources, means I do only "publish" existing dictionaries but not maintain them.
These are the "official" sources for the dicitionaires that have been shipped with OOo 2.x. - See more at: http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/croatian-dictionary-and-hyphenation-patterns#sthash.Vos7GOrM.dpuf
